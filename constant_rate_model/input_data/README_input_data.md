The data used for producing mRNA and protein profiles along the villus axis for parameter estimation stem from the following sources:

- "cell_size_estimation.csv" contains area and length measurements of enterocytes in microscopy images quantifed in units of pixels using ImageJ as part of this study.

- "protein_mRNA_data.xlsx" contains mean protein profiles and their standard errors of mean derived from N=4 mice via spatial sorting and mass spectrometry as part of the current work. Information is given in fraction of total iBAQ. The same file also contains spatial sorting-derived mRNA profiles from bulk transcriptomics, but these are not used for parameter inference (see below).

- "table_B_scRNA_seq_UMI_counts.tsv" and "table_C_scRNAseq_tsne_coordinates_zones.tsv" contain UMI counts and zone annotations respectively, for single enterocytes. The data is taken from Moor et al, Cell 2018 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418311644) and is originally hosted at (https://zenodo.org/record/3403670).
